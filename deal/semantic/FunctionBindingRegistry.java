/**
 * The {@code FunctionExecutionBinding} registry of the BINDINGS
 * capability (ISSUE-0447 registry child; design B5 and the Registry
 * contract): the lowering-time producer of
 * {@code LoweredModuleUnit.functionBindings} — exactly one registration
 * per producing allocation, keyed by
 * {@link FunctionAllocationIdentity} — plus this epic's minimal
 * in-epic ownership of the host/external function-value materialization
 * seam (the classification of host/external function-value producing
 * sites and the {@code HostFunction}/{@code ExternalFunction}/
 * {@code HostFunctionValue} registrations over member-read/export-read
 * op facts and {@code HOST_TO_DEAL} boundary-op facts at the IR level).
 *
 * <p><b>Closed producer entry points.</b> One per producing allocation
 * kind of B5:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #registerClosure} — every {@code CLOSURE_NEW} result →
 *       {@code LoweredBody {functionId, blockId}};</li>
 *   <li>{@link #registerGroupMember} — every {@code RECURSIVE_GROUP_INIT}
 *       member → one {@code LoweredBody} per member keyed by the
 *       member's pre-assigned allocation identity;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #registerAdapter} — every {@code FUNCTION_ADAPT} result →
 *       {@code AdapterBinding {adaptOpId, captureMode, sourceRef,
 *       sourceSignature, targetSignature}} (the registration function is
 *       consumed at the adapter-creation site — the shape-map child's
 *       production);</li>
 *   <li>{@link #registerHostOrExternalImport} — an imported host or
 *       external function value materialized by a member-read/export-read
 *       op, registering {@code HostFunction {hostModuleId, exportName,
 *       descriptor}} or {@code ExternalFunction {moduleId, exportName,
 *       descriptor, executionOwner}};</li>
 *   <li>{@link #registerHostFunctionValue} — a host-materialized
 *       function value produced at a {@code HOST_TO_DEAL} boundary
 *       crossing, registering {@code HostFunctionValue {hostModuleId,
 *       materializingBoundaryOpId, descriptor}}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Seam boundary (explicit).</b> This child does not produce the
 * member-read/export-read op, does not implement member-access or import
 * machinery, and does not produce any {@code BOUNDARY} op — the producing
 * op is the expression-lowering/modules epics' (ISSUE-0234/0239) and the
 * boundary op's production is E4's (ISSUE-0233). The seam is wired at
 * those producers: when their producer emits a member/export read that
 * materializes a function-typed host/external value, or a
 * {@code HOST_TO_DEAL} boundary whose checked descriptor is a function
 * type, it calls the corresponding seam entry with the pinned payload
 * record, the produced {@code FunctionAllocationIdentity}, and the
 * checker facts. Route resolution itself is the modules epic's
 * (ISSUE-0239); this child consumes the resolved {@link ModuleRoutePlan}
 * record and pins the registry shape (shared callee →
 * {@code SHARED_BODY}; retained-ABI callee → {@code RETAINED_ABI} — the
 * closed {@link ExternalExecutionOwner} values). The crossing's execution
 * is E7's; this child executes nothing. Generated {@code @jsonable}
 * synthetics are ordinary {@code CLOSURE_NEW} producers registering
 * {@code LoweredBody} like any function (their production is
 * ISSUE-0238's).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Registration discipline.</b> Exactly one registration per
 * producing allocation: a duplicate-key registration is rejected by the
 * registry at registration time (fail closed, never overwritten), and a
 * function-typed materialization whose producer facts are missing,
 * incomplete, or mismatched fails explicitly — the seam never silently
 * skips a registration. The map is immutable after lowering:
 * {@link #bindings()} is an unmodifiable insertion-ordered snapshot, so
 * repeated lowering of the same checked module yields the same map with
 * identical iteration order (registration order — the unit's production
 * order — feeds the byte-identical {@code deal.semantic-ir/1} dump).
 * One-to-one completeness validation (every producing allocation
 * registered; every key produced exactly once in the unit; every
 * function-typed result resolves to exactly one binding feeding the
 * schema-level R-FUNCTION-BINDING) is the validation child's
 * {@code REGISTRY_ONE_TO_ONE}; R-FUNCTION-BINDING stays the schema's.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Producer-fact classification.</b> Each host/external
 * materialization seam entry also records a
 * {@link FunctionValueMaterialization} classification keyed by the
 * produced allocation identity — the producer fact the shape-map child's
 * import-read arm consumes (a host/external import read is a
 * non-identifier member-read expression → {@code REEVALUATE_THUNK}, B7;
 * there is no VALUE carve-out for import reads). Loads, reads, argument
 * passing, and returns preserve the
 * {@link FunctionAllocationIdentity}, so a consumer always resolves the
 * producing allocation through {@link #materializationOf}.</p>
