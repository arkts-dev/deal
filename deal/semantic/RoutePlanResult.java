 * {@code LoweringFailureDetail} payload — never a crash, never a silent
 * reroute for a fact defect. SHARED-ineligibility — {@code
 * LEGACY_SAFE_INT} profile, {@code PUBLIC_BUILD + PRE_ACTIVATION},
 * {@code STDLIB_TIME_CONFLICT} (detected or propagated), or a required
 * capability not {@code PROMOTED} for the target — reroutes LEGACY at
 * plan time with zero diagnostics: never an error, never a within-run
 * fallback.
