/**
 * The closed normalized slot of {@code INDEX_NORMALIZE}
 * (assignment-delete-address-chains A-D3; parent common-semantic-lowering-layer
 * D14): the sealed two-shape record computed from the normalize payload's
 * {@code {mode, rawKey, currentLength}} triple.
 *
 * <p><b>Closed shapes (A-D3).</b></p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Array modes → {@link ArraySlot} — {@code {index: signed32,
 *       present: index < currentLength, append: index == currentLength
 *       (ARRAY_WRITE only)}}. {@code present} is the {@code ARRAY_READ}
 *       decision; {@code append} is the {@code ARRAY_WRITE} decision (the
 *       append idiom {@code xs[xs.length] = v} normalizes to
 *       {@code append = true}). Negative and out-of-range indices are
 *       represented exactly — the computation never fails and never
 *       enforces bounds: negative/out-of-range enforcement happens only in
 *       the named boundary policies ({@code ARRAY_READ_INDEX_THEN_DESCRIPTOR},
 *       {@code ARRAY_WRITE_BOUNDS_THEN_ELEMENT},
 *       {@code ARRAY_DELETE_BOUNDS}), never in the normalize.</li>
 *   <li>Table modes → {@link TableSlot} — {@code {key: string}}. The key is
 *       total over lowering-reachable targets: A-D10's E3018 checker gate
 *       pins every table index write/delete key to static type
 *       {@code string} before lowering, so the computation performs no
 *       coercion and key identity is preserved exactly ({@code t["0"]}
 *       stays distinct from any other key). For table modes the closed
 *       payload's required {@code currentLength} operand references the raw
 *       key identity and is unused by the computation — no length read
 *       occurs for table targets.</li>
 *   <li>Bytes modes → {@link BytesSlot} — {@code {index: signed32,
 *       present: index < currentLength}} (K6 item 5). There is no append
 *       decision: a bytes buffer is fixed-length and an index equal to the
 *       length is the boundary's pinned E8012, never an append. Negative
 *       and out-of-range indices are represented exactly — the computation
 *       never fails and never enforces bounds.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Purity.</b> {@code INDEX_NORMALIZE} remains pure: policy
 * {@code NO_DEAL_FAILURE} (validator-pinned, R-POLICY-KIND), never raises
 * a DEAL failure, never raises E8002, and touches no storage beyond its
 * completed operands. The computation here is total and deterministic over
 * the closed mode set; a mode outside the computation's shape fails closed
 * with {@link IllegalArgumentException} (an internal producer error, never
 * a DEAL projection). The commit consumes the normalize-computed
 * {@code append} decision; observably this equals a commit-time length
 * comparison because no chain step between normalize and commit mutates
 * storage.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Result type (A-D3).</b> The normalize op's result {@code ValueId}
 * carries the slot's index/key value with
 * {@link ArraySlot#resultType()} = {@code int},
 * {@link BytesSlot#resultType()} = {@code int}, and
 * {@link TableSlot#resultType()} = {@code string}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This record is computation-only: the {@code INDEX_NORMALIZE} op's
 * result wiring is the chain-lowering task's production; the closed
 * payload shapes and the schema-owned records are unchanged.</p>
