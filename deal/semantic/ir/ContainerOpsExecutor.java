/**
 * The single op-level execution form of the six container/string
 * operations of {@code deal.semantic-ir/1} (ISSUE-0384 component C3;
 * ISSUE-0232 design D6; parent closed operation rows
 * {@code TABLE_NEW}, {@code ARRAY_NEW}, {@code MEMBER_READ},
 * {@code ARRAY_LENGTH}, {@code STRING_CONCAT}, and
 * {@code FOR_EACH(STRING_SCALARS)}): a static, pure, deterministic,
 * stateless executor over the semantic value model — the
 * first-insertion-order {@link SemanticTable} (D4), the closed
 * {@link UnicodeScalars} scalar model (D5), and the ordered
 * {@link SemanticArray} element list — plus the value lookup for the
 * payload-referenced prior steps. The semantic oracle (E11) composes this
 * executor with the E2 value-op executor and E4's {@link BoundaryExecutor}
 * into the full interpreter; shared emitters may implement the same
 * contracts over target representations.
 *
 * <p><b>Interpretation surface.</b> The executor interprets only
 * validated op shapes ({@link SemanticOp} records whose kind/payload
 * pairing the {@code SemanticOp} constructor has already enforced) and
 * the closed {@link Value} view — never AST nodes, never target
 * representations, never host code, never identity-keyed checker state.
 * A shape outside the pinned contracts — a wrong op kind, a non-pinned
 * failure policy, an unresolvable prior-step value, a wrong-kind
 * receiver/iterable/fragment, a boundary child of the wrong kind or
 * parentage, an element-boundary count mismatch, an {@code Invalid}
 * fragment inside {@code STRING_CONCAT}, a non-{@code STRING_SCALARS}
 * mode, or a loop-binding load carrying a generation other than the
 * payload's initial generation — fails closed as a producer
 * {@link Defect}, never as a DEAL projection and never as a crash (the
 * same fail-closed discipline as {@link BoundaryExecutor} and
 * {@link SemanticArray}).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Value lookup.</b> Every payload-referenced prior step —
 * {@code TABLE_NEW} entry values, {@code ARRAY_NEW} element values, the
 * {@code MEMBER_READ}/{@code ARRAY_LENGTH} receiver, the
 * {@code STRING_CONCAT} fragments, and the {@code FOR_EACH} iterable —
 * is resolved through the caller-supplied {@code Map<ValueId, Value>}
 * before the op's behavior runs. A referenced prior step the lookup does
 * not resolve is a producer defect (prior steps complete before operation
 * START in the validated machine, so the oracle's lookup always
 * resolves).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Boundary orchestration (D3, pinned).</b> The executor creates no
 * boundary projection: every boundary child is driven through the
 * {@link BoundaryCheckRunner} delegate seam
 * ({@code (BoundaryPayload, Value) → Pass | Fail}). {@code ARRAY_NEW}
 * resolves all element values first (all element prior steps completed),
 * then runs its element-boundary children strictly in payload order; the
 * first failing child fails the op with that child's failure and no
 * partial instance is published (no allocation); only after every child
 * passes does the fresh array allocate. {@code MEMBER_READ} performs the
 * missing-aware read first and then runs its single
 * {@code CONTEXTUAL_TABLE_READ} child; the child publishes the checked
 * value (missing→null for a nullable descriptor, present value checked,
 * E8001 {@code expected {expected}, got missing} for non-nullable
 * missing) — that projection is the delegate's (E4's
 * {@code BoundaryExecutor}), this epic pins the orchestration only. E3's
 * unit tests use pass-through/fail-first fixtures; E4 wires
 * {@code BoundaryExecutor} as the production delegate.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FOR_EACH(STRING_SCALARS)} (D5/D6, pinned).</b> The op
 * validates the complete scalar sequence before the first binding — the
 * op's own {@code TYPE_DESCRIPTOR} terminal check, never a
 * {@code BOUNDARY} child. An {@code Invalid} iterable fails the op with
 * the E8001 projection {@code expected string, got invalid Unicode scalar
 * encoding} (expected {@code string}, actual kind
 * {@code invalid-unicode}, instantiated from the registry's pinned
 * {@code TYPE_DESCRIPTOR} row) at the op's origin and executes no body
 * step. A {@code Valid} iterable yields one single-scalar string per
 * iteration in scalar order to the {@link BodyRunner} callback, each
 * iteration bound to a fresh generation of the loop binding
 * (initial + iteration index); an empty string yields zero iterations.
 * The body-runner callback executes the loop body (E5/E6 control and
 * binding machinery); this epic pins only the iteration protocol, the
 * yield stream, and the loop-binding load-resolution rule (D1): a
 * {@code BINDING_LOAD} of the loop binding inside the body carries the
 * {@code FOR_EACH} payload's {@code generation} field (the initial
 * generation), and at execution the effective generation is
 * {@code initial + current iteration index} — the executor supplies the
 * {@link LoopLoadResolver} that the body-runner applies before the
 * generation check; the payload itself is never rewritten per
 * iteration.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Failure rows.</b> Every op-level failure is instantiated from the
 * pinned {@link FailureContractRegistry} row through
 * {@link BoundaryFailure#fromRow(FailurePolicyRow, int, String, String,
 * Map, BoundaryFailure)} — the executor never selects message text, and
 * consumers never select messages. {@link OpFailure} pairs the
 * structured projection with the executed op's origin (the operation
 * origin of the closed table's rule).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Purity and bounds.</b> No mutation of the unit, no randomness, no
 * I/O, no host code, no retry, no {@code deal.types} dependency; the
 * executor is linear in the entry count, the element count, the fragment
 * count, and the string length, and delegates descriptor-depth work to
 * the boundary delegate (this component recurses over no descriptor).
 * Fresh arrays and tables carry fresh identities (the model's allocation
 * rule); repeated executions with equal inputs produce equal results.</p>
