/**
 * The single op-level execution form of the class-construction operations
 * of {@code deal.semantic-ir/1} (class-construction-jsonable-operations
 * K-D4/K-D11; ISSUE-0512; parent D16 and the normative construction
 * section, the closed {@code CLASS_NEW}/{@code CLASS_DEFAULT} operation
 * rows, and the {@code CLASS_CONSTRUCTION} E8007 policy row): a static,
 * pure, deterministic, stateless executor over the closed value view —
 * extended with the class variant
 * {@code Class {classId, fields: [Present(Value) | Missing]}} preserving
 * missing versus null — plus the value lookup for payload-referenced
 * provided-field prior steps. The sequencing item 2 child (ISSUE-0512)
 * introduced the executor with the
 * {@code CLASS_DEFAULT}/{@code CLASS_NEW(LOCAL)} surface and the pinned
 * delegate seams; this child (sequencing item 3, ISSUE-0513) completes
 * the field-operation surface — {@code FIELD_READ}/{@code FIELD_WRITE}/
 * {@code FIELD_DELETE} with the nominal receiver boundary first and the
 * presence-aware read/commit/idempotent-delete semantics (K-D6) and
 * {@code HAS_FIELD} with the presence boolean (K-D7). The sequencing
 * item 4 child (ISSUE-0514) completes the cross-unit default filling —
 * {@code CLASS_FACTORY} with the K-D5 execution contract (the
 * {@code CLASS_NEW(SHARED_FACTORY)} trigger, the skip-provided rule,
 * the untagged internal transfer, the executed cross-unit
 * {@code parentOpId} pin) and {@code CLASS_NEW(SHARED_FACTORY)} with
 * the K-D4 transfer order, the overlay reorder pin, the
 * {@code CLASS_DEFAULT_FIELD} extraction rule, and the tag-last
 * publication. The {@code JSON_*} surfaces complete the assembled
 * executor in this child (sequencing item 5, ISSUE-0515): the
 * {@code JSON_FROM_CLASS} walk (K-D8/K-D9 — the parse seam, the
 * top-level gate with the {@code {}}/{@code []} collapse, the
 * document-order extra-key gate, the declaration-order provided
 * decode, the per-site {@code CLASS_DEFAULT} children of the
 * {@code JsonDefaultChildTable} record, the nested-class
 * {@code CLASS_FACTORY} trigger, the final validation, the tag, and
 * the {@code JSON_MAX_DEPTH} bound) and the {@code JSON_TO_CLASS}
 * walk (K-D10 — the root identity check, the declaration-order
 * serialization with the pinned fieldPath convention, the
 * path-local cycle set, the call-origin {@code JSON_TO_ERROR}
 * projection, and deterministic RFC-8259 text) over the JSON
 * algorithm delegate seam (K-D11 — E8's
 * {@code SharedStdlibSemantics} is the production delegate).
 *
 * <p><b>Interpretation surface.</b> The executor interprets only
 * validated op shapes ({@link SemanticOp} records whose kind/payload
 * pairing the {@code SemanticOp} constructor has already enforced) and
 * the closed {@link Value} view — never AST nodes, never target
 * representations, never host code, never identity-keyed checker state.
 * A shape outside the pinned contracts — a wrong op kind, a non-pinned
 * failure policy, a non-{@code LOCAL} default owner, an unresolvable
 * lookup value, a wrong-kind value, a boundary child of the wrong kind
 * or parentage, a child-count mismatch, or an input-wiring mismatch —
 * fails closed as a producer {@link Defect}, never as a DEAL projection
 * and never as a crash (the same fail-closed discipline as
 * {@link ContainerOpsExecutor} and {@link BoundaryExecutor}).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Value lookup.</b> Every payload-referenced provided-field prior
 * step resolves through the caller-supplied {@code Map<ValueId, Value>}
 * in literal order before the op's behavior runs (K-D4 step 1). A
 * referenced prior step the lookup does not resolve is a producer defect
 * (prior steps complete before operation START in the validated machine,
 * so the oracle's lookup always resolves). A provided value resolving to
 * the internal {@link Value.Missing} is a producer defect — a provided
 * field always carries a present value, and the missing state exists
 * only for absent slots of the constructed instance.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Layout resolution.</b> The payload carries the layout; the
 * caller-supplied {@code Map<ClassId, ClassLayout>} is the
 * layout-resolution context (K-D11: the unit's {@code classLayouts} plus
 * the project interface index). The executor resolves the payload's
 * {@code classId} against the context and requires the resolved layout
 * to be exactly the payload's layout — an unresolvable or mismatched
 * layout is a producer defect (the payload is never interpreted against
 * a foreign layout).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Boundary orchestration (K-D4 step 5, pinned).</b> The executor
 * creates no boundary projection: every field boundary is driven through
 * the {@link BoundaryCheckRunner} delegate seam
 * ({@code (BoundaryPayload, Value) → Pass | Fail}) strictly in payload
 * (declaration) order; the first failing child fails the op with that
 * child's failure and no instance is published (the tag never runs). The
 * delegate is E4's {@link BoundaryExecutor} in production; this epic's
 * unit tests use pass-through/fail-first fixtures. The pinned child
 * wiring is checked fail closed before each run: kind
 * {@code CLASS_LITERAL_FIELD}/{@code CLASS_DEFAULT_FIELD} matching the
 * payload entry, {@code parentOpId} = the {@code CLASS_NEW} op, the
 * field's declared descriptor, the descriptor-kind policy
 * ({@code TYPE_DESCRIPTOR} for non-function descriptors,
 * {@code FUNCTION_SIGNATURE} for function descriptors), and the input —
 * the field's {@code valueOpId} for provided fields, the field's
 * {@code CLASS_DEFAULT} op result {@code ValueId} for defaulted fields
 * (K-D4 input wiring).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Default application (K-D4 step 2, pinned).</b>
 * {@code CLASS_DEFAULT} children execute in declaration order through
 * the {@link BodyRunner} seam — the block runs exactly once per
 * triggering construction attempt and the callback returns the produced
 * default value; the op carries no boundary of its own and its policy is
 * {@code NO_DEAL_FAILURE}. A child whose field is provided is skipped —
 * a provided field's default never runs. {@code CLASS_DEFAULT} ops are
 * detached structural ops (K-D12: their nesting owner is recorded by the
 * {@code CLASS_NEW} payload's {@code classDefaultOpIds}, not by a static
 * {@code parentOpId}), so the executor checks payload membership and
 * {@code classId} coherence instead of parentage. Per-construction
 * freshness is produced by block re-execution: each triggering attempt
 * invokes the body runner again, so a literal-typed default allocates
 * freshly per attempt (the oracle's machine re-executes the block; this
 * executor pins the per-trigger invocation protocol).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The closed K-D4 order of {@code CLASS_NEW(LOCAL)}.</b>
 * (1) provided values resolve in literal order; (2) default application
 * for omitted required-present fields with declared defaults in
 * declaration order, skipping provided fields; (3) extra-key rejection
 * first in provided-source order — the first provided name not in the
 * layout fails {@code CLASS_CONSTRUCTION} with the registry row's pinned
 * E8007 {@code extra field '{field}' in class '{classId}'} at the op
 * origin, after default application and before any provided-field
 * application or field validation; (4) provided-field application in
 * declaration order (the overlay onto the default-filled instance — the
 * {@code jvm-xmod-class-construction-defaults} reorder pin); (5) field
 * validation in declaration order through the
 * {@link BoundaryCheckRunner} seam per {@code fieldBoundaries} entry;
 * (6) the fresh instance is tagged with {@code classId} and SUCCESS
 * publishes it. A failure at any step publishes no partial instance (the
 * tag never runs); completed children's effects remain observable.
 * {@code CLASS_NEW} runs zero return boundaries and the executor never
 * drives a {@code FUNCTION_RETURN} child.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Failure rows.</b> The E8007 projection is instantiated from the
 * pinned {@link FailureContractRegistry} {@code CLASS_CONSTRUCTION} row
 * through {@link BoundaryFailure#fromRow} with the row's metadata
 * ({@code field}, {@code classId}) — the executor never selects message
 * text, and consumers never select messages. {@link OpFailure} pairs the
 * structured projection with the executed op's origin (the operation
 * origin of the closed table's rule).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Purity and bounds.</b> No mutation of the unit, no randomness,
 * no I/O, no host code, no retry, no {@code deal.types} dependency; the
 * executor is linear in the provided-field count, the default count, the
 * boundary count, and the layout's field count, and delegates
 * descriptor-depth work to the boundary delegate (this component
 * recurses over no descriptor). Fresh instances carry fresh identities
 * (the model's allocation rule); repeated executions with equal inputs
 * produce equal results.</p>
