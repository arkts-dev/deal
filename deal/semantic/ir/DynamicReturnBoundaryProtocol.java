/**
 * The runtime binding-resolution protocol of a dynamically resolved
 * {@code CALL}/{@code ASYNC_START} site (ISSUE-0531): a static, pure,
 * deterministic selection of the execution class and of the recorded
 * return-boundary cell for a callee whose binding kind is unknown until
 * execution.
 *
 * <p>{@link #kindOf(FunctionExecutionBinding)} classifies a resolved
 * {@code FunctionExecutionBinding} into the closed
 * {@link DynamicResolutionKind} set. An {@code AdapterBinding} carries no
 * source kind of its own; the D15 invocation protocol resolves the
 * adapter's source value to its own binding, and the class is derived
 * from that source binding ({@code kindOf(sourceBinding)}) — this method
 * fails closed on an adapter input rather than guessing.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #select(KindPayload.DynamicReturnBoundary, DynamicResolutionKind)}
 * selects the single recorded return-boundary cell the runtime executes
 * for the resolved class, with its closed kind and owner
 * ({@link ReturnBoundarySelection}): {@code DEAL_BODY} → the
 * {@code FUNCTION_RETURN} cell executed by the callee's source
 * {@code RETURN}; {@code HOST} → the {@code HOST_TO_DEAL} +
 * {@code HOST_SYNC_RETURN} cell executed by the call op; {@code EXTERNAL}
 * → the {@code EXTERNAL_RETURN} cell executed by the call op;
 * {@code SHARED_BODY} → {@link ReturnBoundarySelection.None} (the
 * callee's {@code RETURN} under its {@code EXTERNAL_ENTRY} runs the
 * single {@code EXTERNAL_RETURN} in the callee unit). The recorded cell
 * op ids resolve to {@code BOUNDARY} ops and carry their class's closed
 * cell (validator R-BOUNDARY-TRIPLE, the dynamic CALL arm); this protocol
 * never invents or synthesizes a boundary — it selects exactly one
 * recorded cell per resolution.
