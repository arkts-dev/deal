# deal.codegen.jvm — JVM Backend Skeleton (ISSUE-0091)

A small but real end-to-end JVM backend for the DEAL compiler. It walks the
typed AST (the compiler's IR — `deal-compiler-architecture-v1`) and emits a
self-contained Java class whose static methods implement the module's
functions. The Java source is a real JVM artifact: it is compiled by
`javac` and executed by `java` in a subprocess, both in production
(`CompilationOrchestrator` phase 4) and in the conformance harness
(`test/BackendConformanceTest.java`).

## Skeleton scope

Supported (real semantics, spec JVM value mapping):

| DEAL | JVM representation |
|---|---|
| `int` | primitive `long` (checked arithmetic: E8004 overflow, E8005 div-by-zero, E8006 negative exponent; non-finite powers → E8001, matching LuaJIT's `check_int`) |
| `number` | primitive `double` (Lua-style floored `%` via `numMod`) |
| `boolean` | primitive `boolean` |
| `string` | `java.lang.String` (`===` via `equals`; ordering via `compareTo`) |
| `null` | `void` returns / `Void` locals and params |
| functions | `static` methods of the generated module class |
| `let` locals / module fields | locals (shadowing disambiguated `$n`) / `static` fields |
| `if`/`else if`/`else`, `return`, assignment, direct calls | plain Java control flow |
| `int()` / `number()` intrinsics | `intFromNumber` / `numberFromInt` helpers (E8001/E8004) |
| `import * as c from "std/console"` | `c.log` → `System.out.println`, `c.error` → `System.err.println` |

Out of scope (rejected with a backend `E6000` diagnostic, never silently
miscompiled): modules (any import other than `std/console`), classes, arrays,
tables, nullables, function types, stdlib modules, async/await, loops,
try/throw, host ABI, `@jsonable`, template literals, for-of.

The JVM's static type system proves typed boundaries redundant, which the
spec explicitly permits (`docs/spec-v1.1.md` §JVM backend contract: "The JVM
backend may use JVM primitive types, final classes, verifier-checked
bytecode, method signatures, and JIT optimization to prove typed-boundary
checks redundant"). This is why `let z: null = console.log("x")` runs the
print and stores null under JVM while LuaJIT's `check_null` rejects the raw
nil — the JVM backend proves the boundary statically, exactly as the spec
allows.

## Observable-behavior guarantees (rework round)

Every checker-accepted program in scope either compiles to a valid,
behavior-preserving Java artifact or is rejected with E6000 — the CLI never
reports success for an artifact `javac` would reject.

- **Null-typed side effects are never discarded.** `return console.log("x")`,
  `return helper()` (helper: `() => null`), `let z: null = console.log(...)`,
  `x = console.log(...)` (x: null), and null-typed call arguments evaluate
  their expression for its observable behavior: the emitted `nullAnd`
  helper runs the void call and yields `null`
  (`Void z = nullAnd(() -> System.out.println("assign-log"));` —
  the `stmt; Void z = null;` lowering). LuaJIT evaluates the same
  expressions before returning/assigning.
- **Module-level statements run at load time.** Non-declaration module-level
  statements (calls, assignments, `if`s, blocks) are emitted into
  `static { … }` initializer blocks interleaved in source order with field
  initializers, so `console.log("a"); let x = f();` runs `a`, then `f()`
  — exactly where LuaJIT executes module-level statements (require time).
  Module-level `return` is rejected with E6000 (Java initializers cannot
  return).
- **Shadowed initializers bind to the enclosing scope.** The initializer is
  emitted *before* the new local is registered, mirroring Lua's
  `local x = x + 1` (RHS reads the outer `x`): `let x: int = 5; { let x: int
  = x + 1; return x; }` computes 6.
- **Use-before-declaration is rejected, not miscompiled.** A value use of a
  variable before its own declaration with no enclosing binding (a
  self-referential initializer, `console.log(x); let x = …`, a forward
  reference to a later module field) reads nil under LuaJIT and fails at
  runtime; Java would reject the forward reference after the CLI reported
  success. The backend emits E6000 for these instead.
- **Imports are rejected at the import statement.** Any `import` other than
  `std/console` is an E6000 at the import itself — even when unused —
  because the imported module's require-time side effects cannot be
  reproduced by the skeleton (a never-initialized JVM class would silently
  drop them) and multi-module JVM projects must fail loudly.
- **Class names are collision-safe.** The class name derives from the full
  module path (`app/main` → `AppMain`, `sub/main` → `SubMain`), and the
  orchestrator reports E6000 if two modules still map to the same class
  name (e.g. a case-only difference) — an artifact is never silently
  overwritten.
- **Runtime-helper collisions are rejected.** A DEAL function whose name and
  mapped signature duplicate an emitted helper (`intAdd(a: int, b: int)`)
  is an E6000, not a duplicate-method javac error.

## Review evidence: backend-selection seam

- **Selection seam** — `deal/codegen/Backend.java` (`LUAJIT`, `JVM`,
  `fromCliName`). `CompilationOrchestrator` takes a `Backend` in the new
  9-arg constructor; every pre-existing constructor delegates with
  `Backend.LUAJIT` (`deal/module/CompilationOrchestrator.java`). The CLI
  selects it via `--backend <lua|jvm>` (`deal/Main.java`); the project
  manifest selects it via `deal.json`'s `"backend"` field
  (`deal/module/DealConfig.java` now accepts `"jvm"`). LuaJIT remains the
  default everywhere: no flag, no manifest field, and no constructor
  argument all select it.

- **Lua use site** — `CompilationOrchestrator.codegenLuaModule()`: the
  pre-ISSUE-0091 `LuaBackend.generateToFile`/`generateWithImports` emission
  plus `copyRuntimeLibrary`/`copyStdlibModules`, byte-for-byte unchanged,
  dispatched only when `backend == Backend.LUAJIT`.

- **JVM use site** — `CompilationOrchestrator.codegenAllJvm()`: calls
  `JvmBackend.generate(...)` for every module, merges E6000 diagnostics into
  the standard error report (no artifact for a rejected module), writes
  `<ClassName>.java` with collision detection, and fails the compile on any
  E6000. The conformance use site is
  `test/BackendConformanceTest.runJvmAssertions()`: real `JvmBackend`
  codegen → `javac` subprocess (asserts `.class` artifacts exist) →
  `java` subprocess → asserts stdout/error/exit code.

- **Tests proving both** —
  - LuaJIT: the full pre-existing suite (`test/LuaBackendTest`,
    `test/LuaBackendIntegrationTest`, `test/ConformanceTest`,
    `test/conformance/fixtures/*.json` `backends: ["luajit"]`) stays green
    and unmodified.
  - JVM: `test/conformance/fixtures/jvm-skeleton.json` — eleven JVM-only
    fixtures (literals/output, int arithmetic, local variables with
    shadowing, if/else, a frontend compile-error rejected before the
    backend, null-typed return side effects ×2, null-typed initializers,
    module-level load-time statements and assignment, and a shadowed
    initializer computing 6) run end-to-end under
    `test/BackendConformanceTest`.
  - Seam: `test/JvmBackendTest.java` — identifier translation, collision-safe
    class-name derivation, emission, E6000 rejection (including unused
    imports, module-level returns, use-before-declaration, helper-name
    collisions), observable-behavior preservation for null-typed side
    effects/module-level statements/shadowed initializers via
    `javac`+`java` subprocesses, runtime error codes (E8004/E8005/E8006 and
    the E8001 infinity alignment), the orchestrator JVM path (artifact
    exists, compiles, no `.lua`/runtime copied, import rejection,
    class-name collision detection), the orchestrator default staying
    LuaJIT, `DealConfig` and CLI backend selection.

## Tests

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

runs the whole suite (warning-free build — the `E9999` NameResolver-exception
diagnostics in the test harnesses carry the project's
`@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")` precedent). Targeted:

```bash
javac --release 25 -d build deal/codegen/jvm/*.java deal/codegen/*.java \
  deal/ast/*.java deal/types/*.java deal/diagnostics/*.java deal/lexer/*.java \
  deal/parser/*.java deal/checker/*.java deal/ir/*.java deal/module/*.java \
  deal/codegen/lua/*.java deal/Main.java test/*.java
java -ea -cp build deal.test.JvmBackendTest            # unit + seam tests
java -ea -cp build deal.test.BackendConformanceTest    # JVM + LuaJIT fixtures
```

The JVM fixtures require `javac` and `java` on `PATH` (present in any JDK
that builds this repository); when absent, the JVM runtime fixtures are
skipped, mirroring the LuaJIT skip.

## Known skeleton limitations (documented, not silent)

- Multi-module JVM projects are rejected at the backend: any import other
  than `std/console` is E6000 at the import statement (the imported
  module's require-time side effects have no skeleton JVM equivalent), and
  class-name collisions between modules are E6000 — never a silent
  artifact overwrite.
- Module-level forward references are rejected: Java's
  illegal-forward-reference rule forbids `static { …x… }` /
  `static long b = c + 1L;` before `static long c;` is declared, and
  LuaJIT fails at runtime for the same programs (nil read), so these are
  E6000. Module-level *functions* remain hoisted (Java methods are usable
  in any order), matching the checker.
- The typed boundary checks LuaJIT performs on null-typed values
  (`check_null` rejects the raw nil that `console.log` returns) are proven
  redundant by the JVM's static types and skipped, as the spec's JVM
  backend contract permits — see "Observable-behavior guarantees" above.
- String ordering uses UTF-16 code-unit order (`String.compareTo`); LuaJIT
  orders bytewise. Identical for ASCII.
- `--source-map` sidecars are a LuaJIT feature; the JVM path ignores them.
- The generated artifact is a module class without a `main`; the
  conformance adapter compiles it together with a runner that auto-invokes
  the zero-arity exported functions in declaration order and prints
  non-null results (mirroring the Lua harness's auto-invocation).
